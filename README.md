## Project Overview

The Knowledge Base Assistant is a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application that transforms technical document libraries into intelligent, conversational interfaces. Built as a Master's thesis project, it demonstrates production-ready AI application development with comprehensive monitoring and multi-modal access.

**Current Implementation:** This MVP focuses on Oil & Gas industry technical publications, specifically SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers) papers covering organizational behavior management and human performance. However, the architecture is designed for adaptability across any technical domain.

The system intelligently routes queries through multiple retrieval strategies:

1. **Domain-Specific Knowledge Retrieval:** Answers questions directly related to the technical content within the document library using semantic and full-text search.
2. **Intelligent Query Routing:** Uses an LLM router to determine context relevance and gracefully handles out-of-scope queries.
3. **Metadata Discovery:** Efficiently handles bibliographic queries about authors, publication years, and document details.
4. **Multi-Modal Access:** Provides both intuitive web interface and powerful CLI for different user workflows.
5. **Production Monitoring:** Tracks system performance, costs, user satisfaction, and provides real-time analytics.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of technical papers in PDF format. The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline processes these documents and converts them into a structured JSONL format, where each record represents a "chunk" of information.

Each chunk record contains:

-   **Document Metadata:** Information about the entire source document, including:
    -   `title`: The title of the paper.
    -   `authors`: A list of the paper's authors.
    -   `year`: The publication year.
    -   `abstract`: A summary of the paper's abstract.
-   **Chunk Data:** Information specific to that piece of text:
    -   `chunk_id`: A unique identifier for the chunk.
    -   `section_title`: The section of the paper the chunk belongs to.
    -   `page_number`: The page number where the chunk originated.
    -   `content`: The raw text of the chunk.
-   **Embedding:** A vector representation of the content for semantic search capabilities.

The final, processed dataset serves as the knowledge base for the assistant.

You can find the data stored in JSONL format in [`data/data.jsonl`](data/data.jsonl).

## Preparation

### Required Setup

1. **OpenAI API Key**: You need an OpenAI API key for the LLM functionality.
   - Create a new project in your OpenAI account and generate a separate API key
   - Copy `.envrc_template` to `.env` and update the values
   - Replace `YOUR_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key

2. **Docker and Docker Compose**: Required for running the application stack.
   - Install Docker and Docker Compose on your system
   - Ensure Docker daemon is running

### Environment Configuration

Copy the template and update the required values:

```bash
cp .envrc_template .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values:

**Required Variables:**
```bash
# Application (REQUIRED)
OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key-here'

# Grafana (REQUIRED - set your own secure password)
GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD='your-secure-password'
```

**Optional Variables (have sensible defaults):**
```bash
# PostgreSQL (can keep defaults)
POSTGRES_DB=knowledge_base_assistant
POSTGRES_USER=user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

# Application settings
APP_PORT=8000
TZ=Europe/Berlin  # Change to your timezone

# Grafana
GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER=admin
GRAFANA_DASHBOARD_UID='YOUR_UID'  # Auto-generated by system
```

**Note:** The `GRAFANA_DASHBOARD_UID` is automatically set during initialization, so you can leave the placeholder value.

### Python Dependencies (for local development)

For local development outside Docker, install pipenv:

```bash
pip install pipenv
pipenv install --dev
```

## Running the Application

### Quick Start with Docker Compose (Recommended)

The simplest way to run the complete application stack:

```bash
# First time setup - builds images and initializes database
docker-compose up --build -d

# Check all services are running
docker-compose ps

# Access the application
# Web UI: http://localhost:8000
# Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
```

**Important**: The database is reset each time you run `docker-compose down` followed by `docker-compose up`. For subsequent startups that preserve your data, use:

```bash
# Restart existing containers (preserves database)
docker-compose up -d
```

### Running Locally (Development)

If you want to run the application locally for development:

```bash
# Start only PostgreSQL and Grafana
docker-compose up postgres grafana -d

# Stop the containerized app if it's running
docker-compose stop app

# Set up local environment
pipenv shell
cd knowledge_base_assistant

# Initialize database (first time only)
export POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
python db_prep.py

# Run the Flask development server
python app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000` (Flask dev server) while Grafana remains at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Accessing the Database

To inspect the database directly:

```bash
# Install pgcli (if not already installed)
pip install pgcli

# Connect to database
pgcli -h localhost -U user -d knowledge_base_assistant -W
```

Example queries:
```sql
-- View conversation count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM conversations;

-- View recent conversations
SELECT question, answer, timestamp FROM conversations ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5;

-- View feedback
SELECT conversation_id, feedback FROM feedback;
```

### Stopping the Application

```bash
# Stop services (preserves data)
docker-compose stop

# Stop and remove containers (preserves data volumes)
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove everything including data (⚠️ DATA LOSS)
docker-compose down -v
```

</p>

#### 1. **Last 5 Conversations (Table)**
Displays the most recent user interactions with detailed information:
- **Question**: User's original query
- **Answer**: System's response summary  
- **Relevance**: Automated relevance assessment (RELEVANT, PARTLY_RELEVANT, NON_RELEVANT)
- **Timestamp**: Exact time of interaction

This panel helps monitor recent user engagement and response quality in real-time.

#### 2. **+1/-1 Feedback (Pie Chart)** 
Visual representation of user satisfaction through thumbs up/down feedback:
- **Green**: Positive feedback (thumbs up)
- **Red**: Negative feedback (thumbs down)
- **Percentage breakdown** of user satisfaction rates

Essential for tracking user experience and system effectiveness.

#### 3. **Relevancy (Gauge Charts)**
Three separate gauge visualizations showing the distribution of response relevance:
- **NON_RELEVANT**: Responses that didn't address the user's question
- **PARTLY_RELEVANT**: Responses with partial relevance to the query
- **RELEVANT**: Fully relevant and helpful responses

Color-coded gauges (green for good, red for concerning) provide immediate visual feedback on system performance quality.

#### 4. **OpenAI Cost (Time Series)**
Real-time tracking of API usage costs over time:
- **Cost per conversation** in USD
- **Cumulative spending trends**
- **Usage spike identification**

Critical for budget monitoring and understanding operational expenses.

#### 5. **Model Used (Bar Chart)**
Distribution of AI models used across conversations:
- **gpt-4o-mini**: Most frequently used model for cost-effectiveness
- **Other models**: Usage patterns for different model types
- **Model performance correlation** with relevance metrics

Helps understand model usage patterns and optimize model selection.

#### 6. **Response Time (Time Series)**
System performance monitoring showing:
- **End-to-end response latency** 
- **Performance trends over time**
- **System bottleneck identification**

Essential for maintaining optimal user experience and identifying performance issues.

### Database Schema

The monitoring system uses a robust PostgreSQL schema:

**Conversations Table:**
```sql
- id, question, answer, context
- model_used, response_time, relevance
- prompt_tokens, completion_tokens, total_tokens
- eval_prompt_tokens, eval_completion_tokens, eval_total_tokens  
- openai_cost, user_language, timestamp
```

**Feedback Table:**
```sql
- id, conversation_id, feedback (-1 or +1), timestamp
```

### Accessing Raw Monitoring Data

For advanced analysis, connect directly to the PostgreSQL database:

```bash
# Install pgcli (if not already installed)
pip install pgcli

# Connect to the monitoring database
pgcli -h localhost -U user -d knowledge_base_assistant -W
```

**Useful Monitoring Queries:**
```sql
-- Recent conversation metrics
SELECT question, relevance, openai_cost, response_time 
FROM conversations 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Daily cost analysis
SELECT DATE(timestamp) as date, 
       ROUND(SUM(openai_cost), 4) as daily_cost,
       COUNT(*) as conversations
FROM conversations 
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp) 
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- User satisfaction rates
SELECT 
  SUM(CASE WHEN feedback = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as positive,
  SUM(CASE WHEN feedback = -1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as negative,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN feedback = 1 THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) * 100, 2) as satisfaction_rate
FROM feedback;
```

### Grafana Configuration

The Grafana setup is managed through the [`grafana`](grafana/) folder:

- [`init.py`](grafana/init.py) - Dashboard and datasource initialization script
- [`dashboard.json`](grafana/dashboard.json) - Complete dashboard configuration
- [`provisioning/`](grafana/provisioning/) - Automated Grafana provisioning

The dashboard configuration is automatically initialized when the application starts, ensuring consistent monitoring setup across deployments.

### Monitoring Integration

The monitoring system is fully integrated into the application architecture:
